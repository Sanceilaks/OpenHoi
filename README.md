# Note
For now i have no time to maintain this project. In the feature i`ll rewrite it in Rust, but not now.
Why Rust? Cuz C# is too slow for me and i have no desire to follow fucking OOP standards.

# What is it?
OpenHoi - my attempt to create [Hearts of Iron IV](https://store.steampowered.com/app/394360/Hearts_of_Iron_IV/) opensource alternative.<br>
The main reason - the original game is slow, and does not have convenient tools for developing new scenarios<br>
My implementation has Lua Api and writtent in C# with monogame framework<br>
