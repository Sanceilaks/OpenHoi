# What is it?
OpenHoi - my attempt to create [Hearts of Iron IV](https://store.steampowered.com/app/394360/Hearts_of_Iron_IV/) opensource alternative.<br>
The main reason - the original game is slow, and does not have convenient tools for developing new scenarios<br>
My implementation has Lua Api and writtent in C# with monogame framework<br>
