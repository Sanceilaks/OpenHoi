# Summary
OpenHoi - my attemp to create [Hearts of Iron IV](https://store.steampowered.com/app/394360/Hearts_of_Iron_IV/) opensource alternative. 
The main reason - the original game is slow, and does not have convenient tools for developing new scenarios
My implementation has Lua Api and writtent in C# with monogame framework
